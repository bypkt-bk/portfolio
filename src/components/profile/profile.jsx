                        Department of Mathematics and Computer Science. In addition to my studies,
                        I also gain practical experience working with the Science Student Committee's IT department.
                        UX/UI has always fascinated me! This is a great opportunity for me to develop my knowledge and
                         skills in something I'm passionate about. When I worked with Figma, I was completely captivated by design work and
                          I believe I'm on the right track.</p-ui></div>
